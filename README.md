# Artificial-Intelligence

Based on Homework excercises. Some were based on public data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ (the required files are placed with the source code).
Written in varying style of C++ (from C-like to C++11).

# Possible enchancements
N Queens can be optimised for time by heuristically placing starting queens (knight-attack relative positions).

Travelling Salesman Population class is somewhat spaghetti, can be split in 2.
Travelling Salesman can be changed to read info from file.
Travelling Salesman can be parallelised easily if necessary.

NaiveBayesClassifier code is a bit obtuse. Maybe there is a better way to preprocess the data?


# Sidenotes
Graphic representation of the k-means result is given in a Mathematica notebook file. Change the directory variable to correspond with the location of the compiled c++ k-means executable.
